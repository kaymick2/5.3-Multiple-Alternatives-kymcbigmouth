# 5.3-Multiple-Alternatives-kymcbigmouth
On this assignment, there were multiple exercises that required you to change the code that ran the richter scale String within the getDescription method.
I didn't feel like copying them down, so I used an OCR that read screenshots. It (mostly) did a very good job, but in monospace fonts, OCR's sometimes read lowercase L as 1. 
So any commit that says something about formatting errors is meant to fix the OCR's errors.
I should have done the new code and formatting in a single commit for each exercise, but oh well.
